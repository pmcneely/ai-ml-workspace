## Informatics projects
Submodules for recreating bioinformatics topics that hold some interest. 

### AMBER
 - Employs an interesting parameter-sharing approach as a mechanism to search many network arcitectures for an 'optimized' structure (for a given definition of optimized)  
 - Originial source at: https://github.com/zj-zhang/AMBER  
 - Documentation here: https://amber-automl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html  
 - Literature: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.251561v1 (final version at Nat. Mach. Intell.)

 ### artificial_genomes
 - Employs Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture to impute SNP statistics using 1000 Genome Project and compares results with localized population (Estonian) statistics
 - Original source: https://gitlab.inria.fr/ml_genetics/public/artificial_genomes/-/tree/master/1000G_real_genomes
