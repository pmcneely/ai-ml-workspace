# ai-ml-workspace
A sandbox for building/breaking AI/ML toys.

## Organization
Currently organized as top_level/data_set/nn_toolbox(torch|tensor_flow|pyro|other)

Has a top-level .gitignore, as well as lower-level .gitignore files for handling thigns like raw data, etc.

Initially started with only a simple sample neural network, adapted from the PyTorch [quickstart](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html) for use with VS Code's jupyter notebook conversion tools (see e.g. [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks))
